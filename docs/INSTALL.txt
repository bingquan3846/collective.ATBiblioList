============
Requirements
============

Zope 2.7+, 2.6.2, 2.6.4
-----------------------

AT Content Types requires Zope 2.7.x or Zope 2.6.2/2.6.4+. For Zope 2.6.2/2.6.4
you *must* get a fix for the Interface package to fix an issue with nested
interfaces. Get the file Implements.py from the Zope Corp. cvs server at
http://cvs.zope.org/Zope/lib/python/Interface/?only_with_tag=Zope-2_6-branch and
copy it to ZOPE_HOME/lib/python/Interface/. Without it some features may not
work or even break silently!
You shouldn't use 2.6.1 or 2.6.3 due some evil bugs. Zope 2.7 is recommanded 
because of the ordered folder interface.


Python 2.3.3 or 2.1.3
---------------------

AT Content Types should work with Python 2.1.3 (under Zope 2.6.x) and Python
2.3.3 (under 2.7.x and 2.6.x). Python 2.3.3 is recommanded and the backward
compatibility for Python 2.1.x may be dropped when AT and Plone requires
Zope 2.7.x.


Archetypes
----------

AT Content Types is tested with the following AT versions

 * AT CVS HEAD (aka 1.3) after 2004-04-20
   
   Note: Please use the version of AT that is bundled with AT Content Types.
         It's the latest developer checkout.

AT Content Types doesn't work with other versions of Archetypes because some
fixes are missing. Right now it's tested only with the newest cvs version of
Archetypes.

AT Content Types will propably work the AT 1.2.5final but it needs some testing.

AT Content Types would work with AT 1.0.x when someone is willing to backport
some fixes and changes from AT 1.2 or AT 1.3. That is action in actions is a
TALES expression and ordered stuff.


PortalTransforms
----------------

AT Content Types requires the CVS version of PortalTransforms. All older
versions are missing some important bugfixes.

   Note: Please use the version of PT that is bundled with AT Content Types.
         It's the latest developer checkout.

Because PortalTransforms has a problem updating the tools you *must* remove the
mimetypes_registry and portal_transforms manually and reinstall PortalTransforms
using the Quickinstaller. Otherwise some features of AT Content Types may not
work or worse AT Content Types may break.


Plone
-----

AT Content Types requires the templates and icon of CMFPlone for viewing the
types and AT Folder requires some code from PloneFolder, too. It should be easy
to seperate the dependecies if needed.

AT Content Types should work with Plone 2.0 but for better results update
CMFPlone to the latest Plone-2_0-branch	cvs checkout.


=====================
Optional Requirements
=====================

mxTidy
------

Install egenix mxTidy to enable the validation of the body text of ATDocument.
The text is checked and is rejected if it contains wrong xhtml syntax that may
break the user interface of plone. 
You can download mxTidy from http://www.egenix.com/files/python/mxTidy.html


TextIndexNG 2.0.7+
------------------

If you want to use TextIndexNG to index the SearchableText attribute you should
install version 2.0.7 or higher. Only newer versions uses the special hook that
allows indexing the containment of ATFile.
You can download TextIndexNG from http://zope.org/Members/ajung/TextIndexNG/


PortalTransforms helper applications
------------------------------------

You should install all helpers application for PortalTransforms.
For debian users:
apt-get install lynx pdftohtml python-docutils wv xsltproc tidy \
                unrtf ppthtml xlhtml gs-common xpdf-utils catdoc

Python Imaging Library (PIL)
----------------------------

In order to enable the auto resizing feature of ATImage (Archetypes ImageField)
you have to install PIL.


============
Installation
============

Use the QuickInstaller to install AT Content Types. You should install
Archetypes and PortalTransform before installin AT Content Types


========================
Migration from CMF types
========================

** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP **

             YOU MUST (!) BACKUP YOUR ZODB BEFORE MIGRATING!

** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP **

Migration may fail and it could destroy your data. So please backup your ZODB
before migrating to AT Content Types.

Go to the external method 'migrateFromCMFtoATCT' in the ZMI of your portal root.
Run it using the 'test' tab.


==============================
Migration from CMF Plone Types
==============================

Migration from CMF Plone Types to AT Content Types is less tested but should
work like the migration from CMF types.
