============
Requirements
============

Zope 2.7+, 2.6.2, 2.6.4
-----------------------

AT Content Types requires Zope 2.7.x or Zope 2.6.2/2.6.4+. For Zope 2.6.2/2.6.4
you *must* get a fix for the Interface package to fix an issue with nested
interfaces. Get the file Implements.py from the Zope Corp. cvs server at
http://cvs.zope.org/Zope/lib/python/Interface/?only_with_tag=Zope-2_6-branch and
copy it to ZOPE_HOME/lib/python/Interface/. Without it some features may not
work or even break silently!
You shouldn't use 2.6.1 or 2.6.3 due some evil bugs. Zope 2.7 is recommanded 
because of the ordered folder interface.


Python 2.3.3 or 2.1.3
---------------------

AT Content Types should work with Python 2.1.3 (under Zope 2.6.x) and Python
2.3.3 (under 2.7.x and 2.6.x). Python 2.3.3 is recommanded and the backward
compatibility for Python 2.1.x may be dropped when AT and Plone requires
Zope 2.7.x.


Archetypes
----------

AT Content Types is tested with the following AT versions

 * AT 1.2.5rc4 or newer
 * AT 1.3.0a2 or newer
 * AT CVS HEAD after 2004-03-12
 * AT CS release-1_2 branch after 2004-03-12

AT Content Types would work with AT 1.0.x when someone is willing to backport
some fixes and changes from AT 1.2 or AT 1.3. That is action in actions is a
TALES expression and ordered stuff.


CMFPlone 2rc6 or newer
----------------------

AT Content Types requires the templates and icon of CMFPlone for viewing the
types and AT Folder requires some code from PloneFolder, too. It should be easy
to seperate the dependecies if needed.


=====================
Optional Requirements
=====================

mxTidy
------

Install egenix mxTidy to enable the validation of the body text of ATDocument.
The text is checked and is rejected if it contains wrong xhtml syntax that may
break the user interface of plone. 
You can download mxTidy from http://www.egenix.com/files/python/mxTidy.html


TextIndexNG 2.0.6+
------------------

If you want to use TextIndexNG to index the SearchableText attribute you should
install version 2.0.6 or higher. Only newer versions uses the special hook that
allows indexing the containment of ATFile.
You can download TextIndexNG from http://zope.org/Members/ajung/TextIndexNG/


PortalTransforms and helper applications
----------------------------------------

You should install all helpers application for PortalTransforms.
For debian users:
apt-get install lynx pdftohtml python-docutils wv xsltproc tidy \
                unrtf ppthtml xlhtml gs-common xpdf-utils catdoc

Python Imaging Library (PIL)
----------------------------

In order to enable the auto resizing feature of ATImage (Archetypes ImageField)
you have to install PIL.


============
Installation
============

Use the QuickInstaller to install AT Content Types. You should install
Archetypes and PortalTransform before installin AT Content Types

Migration from CMF types
========================

** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP **

             YOU MUST (!) BACKUP YOUR ZODB BEFORE MIGRATING!

** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP ** ** BACKUP **

Migration may fail and it could destroy your data. So please backup your ZODB
before migrating to AT Content Types.

Create an ExternalMethod in the ZMI:

Id:            migrateATCT
Title: 
Module Name:   ATContentTypes.migrateFromCMF
Function Name: migrate

Run it using the 'test' tab.
