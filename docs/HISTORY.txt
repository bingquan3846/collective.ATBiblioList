   instead of recursing into the full side.
   [tiran]

 * Added a findStaledObjects external method to ATCT to find staled objects. It
   is very useful to clean up a site before running the migration.
   [tiran]

   [tiran]

 * Merged ConstrainTypesMixin from the branch into the HEAD. Thx to Leonardo

   easier. Fixed [ 1027283 ] Schema editing very hard.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1035380 ] Problems with createMemberArea and ATCT by adding a
   setFormat() method to ATDocument which is using the translate method to
   map between stupid CMF content types and real mime types.
   [tiran]
   
0.2.0-rc1 - 2004-07-28

 * Removed 'contents' tab and 'add new item' menu from ATTopic [gotcha]

   [gotcha]

0.2-beta7 - 2004-06-27

 * Moved around some code from ATFolder to ATContentType [tiran]

 * Fixed problem with index_html in ATBTreeFolder [tiran]

 * Fixed wrong portal type in Members ATBTreeFolder after migration [tiran]

 * Added initializeArchetype() to ATContentType base class and changed it to
   use edit() instead of update() to make invokeFactory compatible with the old
   cmf types syntax.

 * Fixed problem with _getPortalTypeName in initializeArchetype() phase of
   object creation. Before the fix the portal type name was the original type
   name (e.g. ATDocument) because it was changed after the initializeArchetype
   call by the portal types tool. This issue has caused some wired problems with
   LinguaPlone and workflows. [tiran]

 * ATFile file field and ATImage image field are now language independend.
   Later I will add a I18NImage and I18NFile if needed. Having a seperate type
   for language dependend content for file and image is in my opinion easier to
   understand for people. Besides it's like Zope3. [tiran]

   moved to TemplateMixin some time ago. [tiran]

   trying to compare the mod date after editing the objects. %-) [tiran]

 * Default type of ATDocument and ATNewsItem is configurable in customconfig.py
   [tiran]
   
 * Fixed issues with content type registry and registered templates after
   switching from or to ATCT mode. [tiran]
   
 * Added validation to ATEvent: end date must be after start date [tiran]

 * First release with all unit tests of Archetypes, ATCT and CMFPlone
   tiran-atct-integration branch passing!
