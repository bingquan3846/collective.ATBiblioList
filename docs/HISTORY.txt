0.3-DEVEL - unreleased
======================

  * prepare ATFolder for use with TemplateMixin, use generic /view instead of 
    /folder_listing as default and immediate view.
    [yenzenz]

  * Use a seperate schemata for ConstrainTypesMixin. We may have many mixins.
   This way, we can avoid a long edit form when edit the content.
   [panjunyong]

 * Removed default description text for upload fields for ATFile and ATImage. 
   They are superflouous and don't really add any help to the user. Quite obvious
   what the fields do/mean.

 * Fixed [ 1047878 ] For ical and vcal export, use action icons instead of tabs
   [tiran]

0.2.0-rc5 - unreleased

   which fixes some more ordering issues
   [hahnfeld]

 * atct_topic_view now doesn't call getObject() anymore and is a small
   bit more performant. This also takes some burden from waking up objects.
   (Bug 1079030)
   [ctheune]

 * Made HTML the default content type for documents (and news items).
 * [ctheune]

 * Fixed [ 1080729 ] Wrong permissions for ATDocument.EditableText / setFormat
   [tiran]

   attributes. This can typically happen if there are problems with the
   AccessContentsInfo permission.
   [tesdal]

 * Removed support of Python 2.1 and 2.2 from INSTALL.txt. Some code like 
   migration requires new features of Python 2.3 like generators.
   [tiran]

   [tiran]


0.2.0-rc4 - 2004-11-30

   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1057691 ] Make ATContentTypes tests works with testrunner.py. Thx to

   [dan_t, tiran]

 * Added fix for [ 1063549 ] ATCT migration doesn't migrate order to migrator.py
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1067719 ] Install.py bug: property modified but not assigned by
   removing unnecessary code from Install.py. AT itself is already handling
   use_folder_tabs.
   [tiran]

0.2.0-rc3 - 2004-10-17
======================

 * Added ATContentTypes Site customization policy
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1041830 ] TypeError: cmf_edit() takes at least 3 non-keyword

   [tiran]

 * Set description as primary field for ATEvent. Also use an easier syntax for

   is based on zodb revisions.
   [tiran]

 * Added ExtendingType howto (more to follow)
   [tiran]

 * Recoded migration walkers to use a generator instead returning a list to
   make them much more memory efficient.
   [tiran]

 * Rewritten folder migration to use the depth inside the folder structur
   instead of recursing into the full side.
   [tiran]

 * Added a findStaledObjects external method to ATCT to find staled objects. It
   is very useful to clean up a site before running the migration.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed an ugly bug in ATDocument which was screwing up references on copy.
   [tiran]

 * Merged ConstrainTypesMixin from the branch into the HEAD. Thx to Leonardo
   Rochael Almeida and Jens Werner Klein for their work.
   [yenzens, rochael]

 * Fixed [ 1013853 ] File upload image shows mime-type in widget
   [tiran]

   removing the custom setContentType method. It's not required any more.
   [tiran]

   easier. Fixed [ 1027283 ] Schema editing very hard.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1035380 ] Problems with createMemberArea and ATCT by adding a
   setFormat() method to ATDocument which is using the translate method to

   [tiran]

 * Changed mx.Tidy test to work around [ 1033396 ] Error on refresh.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1036267 ] Some typos in customconfig.py
   [tiran]

   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1027108 ] Inherit criteria not working
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1030660 ] ConstrainMixin: All types are addable in an ATFolder by
   using a default_method to initialize the list of addable types. The method
   _globalAddableTypeIds was added to generate the list.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed a possible problem in allowedContentTypes: Now the method is using
   fti.isConstructionAllowed(context) to verify that the type is constructable.
   [tiran]

 * Added an option called enableConstrainMixin which is a boolean value
   (checkbox). When set to false the constrain mixin is disabled and the default
   list of addable types is generated by using the default values from
   portal_types.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1030662 ] ConstrainMixin: Can't add an ATTopic to portal root by not
   subclassing ConstrainTypesMixin for ATCTFolder. ATCTFolder must ONLY to used
   as a base class for folderish but non folder types.
   [tiran]

 * Added max_depth workaround and logging for [ 1039846 ] Ghosts in catalog
   while migration and endless loop
   [tiran]

0.2.0-rc1 - 2004-07-28
======================

 * Removed 'contents' tab and 'add new item' menu from ATTopic [gotcha]

 * Fixed wrong portal type in Members ATBTreeFolder after migration [tiran]

 * Added initializeArchetype() to ATContentType base class and changed it to
   use edit() instead of update() to make invokeFactory compatible with the old
   cmf types syntax.

 * Fixed problem with _getPortalTypeName in initializeArchetype() phase of
   object creation. Before the fix the portal type name was the original type
   name (e.g. ATDocument) because it was changed after the initializeArchetype
   call by the portal types tool. This issue has caused some wired problems with
   LinguaPlone and workflows. [tiran]

 * ATFile file field and ATImage image field are now language independend.
   Later I will add a I18NImage and I18NFile if needed. Having a seperate type
   for language dependend content for file and image is in my opinion easier to
   understand for people. Besides it's like Zope3. [tiran]

   moved to TemplateMixin some time ago. [tiran]

   a problem with the unit test that was testing the right date. I was
   trying to compare the mod date after editing the objects. %-) [tiran]

 * Default type of ATDocument and ATNewsItem is configurable in customconfig.py
   [tiran]

 * Fixed issues with content type registry and registered templates after
   switching from or to ATCT mode. [tiran]

 * Added validation to ATEvent: end date must be after start date [tiran]

 * First release with all unit tests of Archetypes, ATCT and CMFPlone
   tiran-atct-integration branch passing!
