Description

  This product is an add-on to Raphael Ritz's CMFBibliographyAT.
  It lets portal users organize existing bibliography references
  into lists.
  Bibliography lists can be displayed using one of the standard
  (file system based) bibliography styles shiped with the product,
  or using custom bibliography styles designed by protal users.

  It should not be too difficult for a python programmer to write its own
  file system based bibliography styles. If you do so, please share your
  interesting bibliography styles with the community.

Changes

  Version 0.4

  * Adapted ATReferenceBrowserWidget for choosing Biblio References to add to the list. References can now be found using an extended search form.

  * Adapted translation files (i18n) and the manual accordingly.

  * Moved the BiblioList sorting process (at display time) to the skins, so that it can be customized either on the File System or Through the web from the ZMI. see skins/bibliography_list/sortBibrefDictList.py .

  Version 0.3

  * Sort lists by 1st Author name and publication year.

  * Complete translation (i18n) support.

  * Added security declarations where needed.

  * Better Documentation.

To Do

  * Write unit tests !!

  * Export formatted lists in rtf.

  * More BibrefStyles to come: We'll have to write more specific styles in order to meet the needs of our scientific staff.


Very possible future:

  * As suggested by a few testers/users, a 'very nice to have' functionnality of a bibliolist is to let the list be dynamically updated, based on previous search criteria.
    I think the best way to implement such a functionnality would be to make the BiblioList behave like cmf topics do.
